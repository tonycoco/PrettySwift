## Usage

### Format

To format your code, open a Swift file you want to format and choose `Editor > PrettySwift > Format` from the menu bar.

### Lint

To lint your code, open a Swift file you want to lint and choose `Editor > PrettySwift > Lint` from the menu bar.

### Integration

If you want to use a keyboard shortcut to format your code, you can add one in `System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts`. Click the `+` button, choose `Xcode` as the application, type `Editor->PrettySwift->Format` as the menu title, and then choose a keyboard shortcut like `âŒ˜S`.
